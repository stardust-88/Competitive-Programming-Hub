<p>Pre and Post numbers are widely used in graph algorithms. For example, they can be used to find out whether a particular node lies in the sub-tree of another node.
To find whether u lies in the sub-tree of v or not we just compare the pre and post number of u and v. If pre[u] > pre[v] and post[u] < post[v] then u lies in the sub-tree of v otherwise not.<p>
