This section is about the (mod n) notation. For the binary operation mod(a,n), see modulo operation.
Given an integer n > 1, called a modulus, two integers are said to be congruent modulo n if n is a divisor of their difference, that is, if there is an integer k such that a − b = kn.

Congruence modulo n is a congruence relation, meaning that it is an equivalence relation that is compatible with the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Congruence modulo n is denoted:

{\displaystyle a\equiv b{\pmod {n}}.}{\displaystyle a\equiv b{\pmod {n}}.}
The parentheses mean that (mod n) applies to the entire equation, not just to the right-hand side (here b). This notation is not to be confused with the notation b mod n (without parentheses), which refers to the modulo operation: b mod n denotes the unique integer a such that 0 ≤ a < n and {\displaystyle a\equiv b{\pmod {n}}.}{\displaystyle a\equiv b{\pmod {n}}.}

The congruence relation may be rewritten as

{\displaystyle a=kn+b,}{\displaystyle a=kn+b,}
explicitly showing its relationship with Euclidean division. However, b need not be the remainder of the division of a by n. More precisely, what the statement a ≡ b (mod n) asserts is that a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. That is,

{\displaystyle a=pn+r,}{\displaystyle a=pn+r,}
{\displaystyle b=qn+r,}{\displaystyle b=qn+r,}
where 0 ≤ r < n is the common remainder. Subtracting these two expressions, we recover the previous relation:

{\displaystyle a-b=kn,}{\displaystyle a-b=kn,}
by setting k = p − q.
